## What is Chategories??
Use the Chategories app with your friends or study groups to share information on topics of your choice! 

The Chategories app was based around the idea of sharing knowledge/information on topics, and then building a community around each topic. If you're someone who enjoys chatting about JavaScript then search for a JavaScript forum and chat away with people of similar interests. Make new friends and share the knowledge.

Update your profile to let everyone know who you are and what you look like with a photo uploader and updatable bio section.

Head to the forum page, located in the center of the footer, to see what people are chatting about. From there you can either click on Chategory topics OR create your own topic! Once inside of a Chategory topic forum you can instant message with many users at once. If you find someones thought process to be particularily appealing, you can then go to their profile and send them a private direct message.
